# Udacity-Data-Visualization-Nano-Degree
This repository contains all the data visualization projects completed as a part of the nano-degree curriculum.

### Project 1: [Build a Data Visualization]

In this project, Tableau dashboard is created to reveal insights from a data set. Task was to created data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. The work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### Project 2: [Dashboard Desigining]

In this project, we incorporated the new skills learned around dashboard designed to grab your audienceâ€™s attention. Focoused on the key elements of the dashboard that continue acknowledging the audience's level of graphicacy, conscious management of color to avoid confusion, and our innate ability to identify patterns so those who find your dashboard are drawn to the key points.

### Project 3: [Data Stroytelling]

In this project we  bring together all the concept which I learned about data storytelling by combining the ghost deck and their analyses to provide a final recommendation. Identify the limitations and biases in data that affect the recommendations provided.

### Project 4: [Advanced Data Story Telling]

Our goal of this next phase of the project is to create an animated bubble chart, make a story out of it, and add audio to narrate the story. The data set used for this project is taken from the world bank data energy_environment_economy.csv to build out your narrated story in Flourish.

### Project 5: [Capstone Project]

The purpose of the data visualization capstone project is to give you a chance to combine what we've learned throughout the program. As a part of a project I wrote a blog to describe how I would improve an existing visualization.
